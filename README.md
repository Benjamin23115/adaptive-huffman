Something to note is that I wasn't able to completely finish this up in-time as I have conflicting tests for other classes that took priority.

I made the bat files to help myself when debugging (ran out of time) the code.

Feel free to change the alphabet.txt and message.txt in the encode.bat to match whatever you'll use (if you decide to use the bat file that is).
