# Adaptive Huffman Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

The Adaptive Huffman algorithm maintains an evolving Huffman tree to efficiently encode and decode data as it changes over time. The algorithm works as follows:

## B-Tree Class Functions

The Adaptive Huffman algorithm should have the following functions:

### Initialization

1. Initialize the Huffman tree with a single root node and a predefined escape character.
2. Set the frequencies of all other characters to 0.
3. Create data structures to manage the tree and frequencies.

### Input Data Processing

1. Read the input data character by character.
2. For each character in the input data, perform the following steps:

### Tree Update

a. **Check if the character is in the tree**: - If the character is not in the tree, create a new node for it with a frequency of 1. - If the character is in the tree, increment its frequency.

b. **Update the tree**: - Reorganize the tree to maintain the Huffman property: - Swap nodes as necessary to ensure that nodes with higher frequencies are higher in the tree. - Update parent nodes to maintain the property.

c. **Output Encoding**: - Output the binary code for the character based on its position in the tree.

4. Periodically, check if the tree has grown too large, and adjust the frequencies and tree structure if necessary. This ensures the tree remains compact.

5. Output the current state of the Huffman tree for debugging and decompression.

6. Continue processing the input data until the entire data is encoded.

7. Output the binary representation of the input data using the final Huffman tree.

8. Implement a decompression algorithm that uses the same tree-building logic to decode the compressed data.

## Comments for Each Step

- **Initialization**: Start with a simple tree containing only the escape character to ensure that any character encountered can be represented.

- **Input Data Processing**: Read the input data character by character.

- **Tree Update**:

  - When a new character is encountered, check if it's already in the tree. If not, add it with a frequency of 1.
  - Maintaining the Huffman property is essential to ensure efficient compression and decompression. This involves swapping nodes and updating parent nodes as needed.

- Periodic tree adjustment is important to avoid excessive growth and maintain efficiency. Adjusting frequencies can help ensure the tree remains compact.

- Outputting the encoded data is the final step in compression, providing a compact representation of the input data.

- Decompression uses a similar tree-building process, allowing the compressed data to be decoded.

By following these steps, you can implement the Adaptive Huffman algorithm for data compression effectively.

## Decoding Steps

The decoding process for the Adaptive Huffman algorithm involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization**: Start with the initial Huffman tree containing the escape character as the root node. Ensure that the tree structure matches the encoding process's initial state.

2. **Read Encoded Data**: Read the binary-encoded data bit by bit.

3. **Tree Traversal**: For each bit read from the encoded data, traverse the Huffman tree from the root node accordingly.

   - If the bit is 0, move to the left child of the current node.
   - If the bit is 1, move to the right child of the current node.

4. **Character Identification**:

   - Continue traversing the tree until a leaf node is reached.
   - Identify the character associated with the leaf node.

5. **Output Character**: Output the identified character.

6. **Tree Update**: After outputting the character, update the Huffman tree to reflect the newly decoded character.

   - If the decoded character is the escape character, consider it as a request to add a new character to the tree.
   - Adjust the tree structure to accommodate the new character and maintain the Huffman property.

7. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2 to 6 for the entire encoded data.

8. **Decoding Completion**: Once all encoded data is processed, the decoding process is complete.

## Comments for Each Step

- **Initialization**: In decoding, we start with the same initial tree structure used during encoding. This ensures that decoding matches encoding's initial state.

- **Tree Traversal**: Traverse the tree bit by bit according to the encoded data. The traversal process is fundamental to decoding.

- **Character Identification**: Identify the character associated with the leaf node reached during tree traversal. This is how the algorithm decodes characters.

- **Output Character**: Output the decoded character, and it becomes part of the decoded data.

- **Tree Update**: After decoding a character, the tree needs to be updated to reflect the new information. This step ensures that the tree adapts to the changing data.

- **Decoding Completion**: The decoding process continues until all encoded data is processed, at which point the entire data is decoded.

By following these steps, you can successfully decode data that has been encoded using the Adaptive Huffman algorithm.
