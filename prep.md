# Adaptive Huffman Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

The Adaptive Huffman algorithm maintains an evolving Huffman tree to efficiently encode and decode data as it changes over time. The algorithm works as follows:
The Adaptive Huffman algorithm should have the following functions:

### Initialization

1. Initialize the Huffman tree with a single root node and a predefined escape character.
2. Set the frequencies of all other characters to 0.
3. Create data structures to manage the tree and frequencies.

## Encoding Steps

- **Initialization**: Start with a simple tree containing only the escape character to ensure that any character encountered can be represented.

- **Input Data Processing**: Read the input data character by character.

- **Tree Update**:

  - When a new character is encountered, check if it's already in the tree. If not, add it with a frequency of 1.
  - Maintaining the Huffman property is essential to ensure efficient compression and decompression. This involves swapping nodes and updating parent nodes as needed.

- Periodic tree adjustment is important to avoid excessive growth and maintain efficiency. Adjusting frequencies can help ensure the tree remains compact.

- Outputting the encoded data is the final step in compression, providing a compact representation of the input data.

- Decompression uses a similar tree-building process, allowing the compressed data to be decoded.

By following these steps, you can implement the Adaptive Huffman algorithm for data compression effectively.

## Decoding Steps

- **Initialization**: In decoding, we start with the same initial tree structure used during encoding. This ensures that decoding matches encoding's initial state.

- **Tree Traversal**: Traverse the tree bit by bit according to the encoded data. The traversal process is fundamental to decoding.

- **Character Identification**: Identify the character associated with the leaf node reached during tree traversal. This is how the algorithm decodes characters.

- **Output Character**: Output the decoded character, and it becomes part of the decoded data.

- **Tree Update**: After decoding a character, the tree needs to be updated to reflect the new information. This step ensures that the tree adapts to the changing data.

- **Decoding Completion**: The decoding process continues until all encoded data is processed, at which point the entire data is decoded.
